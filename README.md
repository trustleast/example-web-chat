## web-chat

A simple app that summarizes any text provided using LLMs via Peerwave's network.

View it at [chat.peerwave.ai](https://chat.peerwave.ai).

This app is built on a minimal React + TypeScript + Webpack setup.

The majority of the logic is in [src/App.tsx](src/App.tsx).
While this is a dense script, the majority of the logic is around keeping track of chat messages.

## Deploy

You can build the app for static distribution via `npm run build`

## Test

You can test the app locally via `npm run dev`
